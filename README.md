# Email Wizard

A wizard who structures all your emails for you and deliver them to you in calendar.

## Disclaimer

Preview! The service is under active development. Things may change quickly and drastically. Security and Privacy may be vulnerable. We currently store all parsed emails in our server. Email parser is implemented with OpenAI's ChatGPT API, which means that your emails will be sent to OpenAI. OpenAI claims that they will not store and use data sent by API but there is not way to guarentee.
